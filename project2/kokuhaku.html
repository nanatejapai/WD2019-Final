			I do not want to be a saint.
			I am not being noble by keeping the identity of A and B a
			secret. I haven't told the police because I simply don't trust the law
			to punish them. A fully intended to kill Manami but didn't actually
			cause her death; while B had no desire to kill her but brought
			about her death. If I did hand them over to the police, they probably
			wouldn't even be sentenced to a juvenile institution; they'd be let
			out on probation and the whole thing would be forgotten. I wish I
			could electrocute A. Drown B like he did my daughter. But neither
			punishment would bring back Manami. Nor would they be able to
			repent for their crimes if they were already dead. I wanted them to
			understand the value, the terrible weight, of human life, and once
			they'd understood, I wanted them to fully realize the consequences
			of what they had done-and to live with that realization. So how
			was I supposed to accomplish this?

			<h3>
			I know someone who lives with this kind of weight on his shoulders.
			He provided me with some inspiration.
			If you'll remember, this whole discussion started with the idea of
			calcium deficiency, but calcium isn't the only thing we lack. In the past,
			Japanese people had a refined sense of taste, but these days it's said that
			more and more children can't even tell the difference between hot and
			mild curry, a problem supposedly caused by a zinc deficiency. So, I wonder
			about all of you-how sensitive are your tongues? A and B, specifically-
			their tongues. It looks as though you all finished your milk, but did any
			of you notice an odd flavor? Perhaps a bit like iron? You see, I added some
			blood to the cartons that went to A and B this morning. Not my blood. The
			blood of the most noble man I know-Manami's father, Saint Sakuranomi.
