        <h3>Frank Chimero, What Screens Want</h3>
        <p>An interesting reading that make me reflect how far technology has changed our surrounding and perceptions. The idea of screen and web was not even exist before and now it becomes normal. Looking back we have broaden our horizon and perception on the idea of possibility. We have came far and now we think about new possibilities and make them happen.</p>

      <div class="read">
        <h3>Paul Ford, What is Code?</h3>
        <p>The reading gives me insights of different coding languages in the world. It is useful to know their functions and usability. After reading, I came to understand why a certain language is well used and some are disappeared. We live in a spontaneous world and we are all in need of the most effective and fastest way to work. I love how John Backus “started work on a programming system to make it easier to write programs,” because it is basically how most of the programs came from. Through out the reading I can interact with the web which emphasizes how important coding is and what it can do.</p>

        <h3>Alexander R. Galloway, Jodi's Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>The reading made an interesting point about medium and art. Artist usually thinks about the medium and how it support or add on the content they have. However, we don’t really concern about the potential and meaning of the digital world. Perhaps, it is because of the lack of knowledge about coding and programming. Still, I think there are always ways we can use digital media as a meaningful medium of art just like how Jodi did.</p>

        <h3>Olia Lialina, Vernacular Web 1</h3>
        <p>A nostalgic and informational reading. The reading brings back the memory of what web site used to be like when it first got invented or when I was really young. I agree that the old website, that is full with the animated gif and background and welcoming message, feels more real and personal. These days all the websites look the same because they were made by sites like Square Space and Cargo.</p>

        <h3>Louise Drulhe, Critical Atlas of Internet</h3>
        <p>The reading does a great job at explaining abstract concept of internet through the use of diagram. It is quite fascinating that as we use the internet, it adapts itself and gives us personalized information. This idea somewhat aligns with the previous reading on how big companies like Google and Facebook design the internet in this way to steal our privacy. the internet is fascinating and scary in the same time.</p>

        <h3>Samuel Earle, Capitalism vs. Privacy</h3>
        <p>A very insightful and though-provoking reading. I have been interested in the idea of privacy and internet and how it can affect our security. I think most of people do not realize how scary the lack of privacy in the internet world is. They’re rather enjoyed the convenience that the corporates provide for them. However, just like in the reading, I think we should start having a real conversation about our privacy in internet.</p>

        <h3>New Clues</h3>
        <p>The reading is not opinionated toward positive or negative sides of internet but rather give us an observation of what has been happening in the digital world. The content is rather poetic and bittersweet. The internet gives us joy, information, and most importantly help us connect to each others. However, we also show more hatred toward each other and forced to share our privacy to big corporates. </p>
